Welcome to my personal website! I am a PhD student in Political Science at George Washington University. My areas of interest include American elections, mis/disinformation, and public opinion.

Previously, I was a research assistant at the Pew Research Center, a research intern at the Brookings Institution, and a student fellow at the Penn Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies (PORES). I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the University of Pennsylvania and a Master of Arts in Political Science from George Washington University.

I can be reached via email (jacobausubel@gwmail.gwu.edu).
