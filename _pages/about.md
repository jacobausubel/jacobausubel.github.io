Welcome! I am a PhD student in Political Science at George Washington University, specializing in American Politics and Research Methods. My areas of interest include elections, mis/disinformation, and public opinion.

Previously, I was a research assistant at the Pew Research Center, a research intern at the Brookings Institution, and a student fellow at the Penn Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies (PORES). I hold a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Pennsylvania and a Master of Arts from George Washington University.
