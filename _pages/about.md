Welcome! I am a PhD student in Political Science at George Washington University, specializing in American Politics and Research Methods. My research focuses on elections, mis/disinformation, and public opinion. Using machine learning, original survey experiments, and secondary data analysis, I explore questions related to American political behavior.

Prior to my graduate studies, I was a research assistant at the Pew Research Center, a research intern at the Brookings Institution, and a student fellow at the Penn Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies (PORES). I hold a BA in Political Science from the University of Pennsylvania and a MA in Political Science from George Washington University.
