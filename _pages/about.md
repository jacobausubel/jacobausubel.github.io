Welcome! I am a PhD student in Political Science at George Washington University, specializing in American Politics and Research Methods. My areas of interest include elections, mis/disinformation, and public opinion. Further details about ongoing research projects can be found on this website.

Beyond research, I also serve as a teaching assistant in my department. I have led discussion sections for two courses: Introduction to American Politics (PSC-1002) and Scope and Methods of Political Science (PSC-2101).

Prior to my graduate studies, I was a research assistant at the Pew Research Center, a research intern at the Brookings Institution, and a student fellow at the Penn Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies. I hold a BA in Political Science from the University of Pennsylvania and a MA in Political Science from George Washington University.
